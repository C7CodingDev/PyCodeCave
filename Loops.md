### Loops
To make a Loop do this code:
```python
for i in range(3): # In range put in how many Times you want the code to repeat
 print('You can add other stuff too!')
```
our code should do this 3 times:
```
You can add other stuff too!
You can add other stuff too!
You can add other stuff too!
```
To do a infinate loop do the following:
```python
while True:
 print('this might crash stuff')
 ```
and it should print it a bunch of times.
