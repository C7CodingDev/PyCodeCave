### Python 'if:'
Hello! In this part we will be learning the `if` and `else` statment!
a `if` and `else` statment is used for codes like to check if the response is correct:
```python
my_var = input('AWNSER: ')


if my_var == 'my_awnser':
 print('My_Correct_Text')

 ```
 our output for a correct should be:\
 `Correct Text`\
### Python 'Else:'
remember our if statment? well we can make a else to print somthing if it does not match it! this is how:
```python
my_var = input('AWNSER: ')


if my_var == 'my_awnser':
 print('Correct Text')
else:
 print('Incorrect Text')
```
 output for a incorrect one should be:
 ```
 Incorrect Text
 ```
