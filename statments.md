### Python 'Else:'
Hello! In this part we will be learning the `if` and `else` statment!
a `if` and `else` statment is used for codes like to check if the response is correct:
```python
my_var = input('AWNSER: ')


if my_var == 'my_awnser':
 print('My_Correct_Text')
else:
 print('Incorrect_Text')
 ```
 our output for a correct should be:\
 `My_Correct_Text`\
 incorrect text:\
 `Incorrect_Text`\
