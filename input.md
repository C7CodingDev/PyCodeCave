the user will hit enter to submit\
Your probebly wondering: How do I store the user's response? right?
to store a input response we need to store it in a **Varible**\
```python
My_Varible = input('Are you stored?')
```
if the user says `no` as the response it will be stored: to see if its stored do this:\
```python
print(My_Varible)
```
our ouput should be\
```
no
```
