### Varibles
Like in the previos course we know that it can be used to store stuff! This is how we would do it\
to store numbers:
```python
Var_Name = 8 #this can be any number
```
to store letters:
```python
Var_Name = 'My Text In This Var!' #The text inside a Var can contain special carectors. unsupported showes : â–¡
```
A Variable name cannot contain a space or special carector however underscores ( _ ) are allowed
A Var also must contain something or it will show an error
